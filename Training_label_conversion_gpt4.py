Next, based on the description of clothing I gave at the end of this paragraph, match and select words in each of the above categories, and eventually give me the major category and selected subcategories, each on a separate line. You need to output all the tag categories. Please output all categories. If you come across something you can't recognise, output "-----". 
The vocabulary must be the same as I wrote, no other words or brackets!!
Output all categories.
Note that you can't create new vocabulary in the categories where I've given you vocabulary, you can only choose from the words I've given you. You cannot have words that are not covered in the sentence.
Don't fill in the elements of the sentence that aren't deciphered on your own, I need you to lower your creativity.
Categories that do not exist in a sentence cannot be created.
Write content in the same category on the same line.
The output format is as follows:
